            <h2>Queen Amidala Costume</h2>
            <p class="itemPrice">$65.99</p>
            <p>Being the Queen of Naboo isn't all about the poise and stature of simply looking queenly. It's not just all about drinking tea and eating crumpets. It's much more about dodging assassination attempts placed on your life, trying to negotiate peace with the Trade Federation, and blasting bad guys who threaten the safety of Naboo with a sleek looking pistol! Well, that and you have to look like a regal and distinguished leader throughout all the whole ordeal AND deal with Jedi who really just do their own thing and never listen to you. Yeah, we're looking at you, Qui-Gonn Jinn! In the midst of all of this, Queen Amidala pulls it off, with some insane poise and leadership, even bringing about a peace between her people and the Gungans (with a little help from Jar-Jar).</p>
