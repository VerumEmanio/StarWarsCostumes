## After P1-F

Great progress. A few more notes towards your final submission:

* Note that when you have `main` you likely don't also need `section#site-content`
* no pressure to allow "quantity" for products but rather simply point to a website where the product can be purchase.
* `mensJangoFett.html` some text is not marked.
* On article list and on the article itself for the One Chart you have a note about a "drop-down window" but this is not something we cover in class. Just be sure you have a plan clarified for this as needed.


## After P1-E revisions

Much improved and looking more like the sample site now. A few things to push on:

* Consider adding a `main` element on each page between `header` and `footer` to ensure a fully consistent document structure.
* Watch throughout the main page, articles page and products page that you're intentional to use headings when necessary, and to only use `b` filling an entire `p` when necessary. We'll be able to select a `p` with CSS and make it bold if we want, so prefer adding `b` only when its necessary to distinguish part of some content from others. `em` and `strong` make a little more sense wrapping all of an element since they add a little more semantic value than `i` and `b`. Hope this makes sense. Bottom line, `<p><b>...</b></p>` feels a little redundant and perhaps either ought be just a `p` that we will later style to be bolded, or otherwise might ought to be some form of heading.

## After P1-E

You're on the right track but have some work to do to meet this deliverable. Your content on each page should conform more towards the sample site provided in the project instructions' Resources section. Otherwise the markup you have is good overall; just need to push on it more.
